# Emotion Identification from Facial Expression - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

In the following multi-class image classification project, PyTorch and CNN technique has been employed to recognize emotion from facial expressions within a dataset of 15,000 images. This projects includes the following sections:

* Loading the dataset
* Building the model
* Defining loss function and optimizer
* Trainig the model and evaluation
* Testing the model
